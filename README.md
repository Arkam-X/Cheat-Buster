# Cheat Buster - Interview Transparency Monitor

Online interviews have introduced a new challenge: Where Candidates can use AI tools and hidden browser tabs that are **not visible** to interviewers during screen sharing.

**Cheat Buster** is a hybrid **desktop + browser transparency system** designed to prevent AI-assisted cheating during online interviews by making all active applications and websites **visibly transparent** to the interviewer via screen sharing.

Cheatings in Online Interviews! Not any more.

Cheat Buster solves this by:
- Displaying all **active desktop applications**
- Displaying all **active browser tabs**
- Showing everything in a **floating overlay** that is shared on screen
